## Project Description 
---

Collectively as a group we pitched different ideas to each other, in response to the theme revolutionsing finance for 2023. A key challenge was being able to identify the ideas that would best marry up, with our time schedule. After realising some ideas would be overly ambitious, we concluded that there could be ingenuity in simplicity. 

Hitting upon our idea, we delved further into how we could ensure that we solved a **problem**, and we responded to this, with the implementation of our tech skills. We discussed how our potential target audience could be handling budgeting, at a time where our living standards are suffering, because of the cost of living and energy crisis. Everyone has had to be a bit more thrifty and cut back where they can. What we wish to achieve is a budgeting app, that uses visual representations, to enable the indiviudal to make better choices on how they spend and save their money, over a peroid of time. 

Initially the user will sign up to the application and take a personality test, this will allow a randomiser to generate user specific visuals from their answers. For instance over a peroid of a week how often does the user buy a cup of coffee, in turn this will generate the weekly cost in either sterling, dollars or euros. In order to have real time exchange values we will have to use an api, to interact with out application. 

### Concept 
---

Coding being logic based creativity allowed us to explore and critique our methods as we progressed through the project, we were able to utilise the huddle feature, on slack, to keep regular contact with the team, which allowed us to pursue our vision and concept in a uniformed way. We needed to keep asking who, what, why and how questions in order to achieve what we set out to do. 

Main conceptual points are as follows:

* Interact with our audience in a fun and engaging way, **times are hard** dont be too serious e.g. this could be represented by using a playful colour pallete and widgets.
* Ask questions to guage the individuals personality, we have decided to start with **10 questions** but if we had more development time we would certainly add more.
* Use a **progress bar** to give a visual representation to the user on the number of questions that need to be answered.
* By specifiying how much money the user wants to save the app will generate a response using visual representations of **life style spending habbits**. 
* Alerting the user to the fact that by **reducing** their **consumption** of for example coffee they will be able to save their desired amount of money over a **peroid of time**.

### Intention
---

Penny Smart aims to be marketed towards userbases, who use modern banking applications like **Monzo**, **Revolut** and **Starling**. These banks, allow for their users, to interact, with their budgetting needs. The application we aim to create, could be pitched to likes of these modern banks as a new way for their user bases's to interact with their app in a engaging way. 

### Audience
---

Our target audience would be those predominantly feeling the pinch, as a result of the cost of living crisis. Communicating in a fun and engaging way is key to how we will respond to our potential user basis's concerns and needs. Taking a less serious approach would act as ice breaker, making the world of finance feel a bit more digestable to the **every day joe**. Age range would vary between 18-30 year olds on average.


## Wireframes

---

### Initial Wireframes

---



The first frame test the intension of the user to save and how much he will like to save a particular period. It includes a progress bar and a nav bar to enable the user identify how far he is to getting the suggestions on improving his savings. The user is able to choose his desired currency.
After showing intrest, the user is able to use the next button to start the process.

The second frame shows an increasing progress bar with question to how much the user desires to save and it presents a toggle button to switch between months and days.

##### Wireframe 3 description: The third frame is displayong a question that relates to lifestyle habit to guage their consumption, the user is able then able to proceed to the next question.

![question-3](Wireframes/question-3.png)

##### Wireframe 4 description: The fourth frame guages further lifestyle habit to also guage consumption, the user is then able to proceed to the next question.

![question-4](Wireframes/question-4.png)

##### Wireframe 5 description: The fifth frame ask about the consumption of coffee by the user as an input to the randomization figures using radio buttons to indicate true or false and also to indicate the amount of times, 
##### the user is able then able to proceed.

![question-5](Wireframes/question-5.png)

##### Wireframe 6 description: The sixth frame seeks about the users spending on luxuries, here the progress bar shows almost complete and the user is able to proceed to the last question.


![question-6](Wireframes/question-6.png)

##### Wireframe 7 description: The seventh frame ask about the users personal choices, options are selected with radio button providing input to the randomization.

![question-7](Wireframes/question-7.png)

##### Wireframe 8 description: The final frame shows the result of the randomization done and presented in the form of suggestions to the user on how they can spend money more wisely and save their desired total.

## Features
---
* #### Header
    * 

This shows the user the progress they have made with engaging the available questions. The progress bar are assigned as part of ways to improve user experience of the project.

---
* #### Footer
    * 

* #### Unified Colour Scheme
 [Original colour pallete test using coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/05668d-427aa1-ebf2fa-679436-a5be00)
    
    * Discussing the colour palletes allowed us to think about the our audience and who it would appeal to, this was a first deom and we decided that muted coolours would be better suited as the greens came across quite aggressively and didnt communicate our concept as well as it could of done.
 [Final colour pallete test using coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/49c6e5-54defd-fffbfa-00bd9d-8bd7d2)
   
    * We believed that this colour pallete situated itself better in conjunction with our concept and theme. The color meaning behind blue green refers to harmony and prosperity. The blue tint evokes trustworthiness and wisdom.
* #### Navigation
    * 

* #### Progress Bar
    * 

* #### Radio Buttons
    * We chose to use radio buttons because it is a simple way to let out our questions and answers to allow the user to interact with the application with ease. 

* #### Peronality Questions
    * 

* #### Currency Converter
    *

### Widgets

## Technology, Frameworks and Programs

### Languages

* HTML



* JavaScript

* CSS

* API

### Frameworks and Programs

* Materialize
    * Initially the team mates who were tasked with Materialize found using CSS more comfortable, but they welcomes the challenge. They believed that the colours were quite restricted, however, during a team talk we worked out that this can be overided with a custom colour. We learnt that it acts as a template that uses industry standard assets and allowed us to save a large amount of time to achieve the visual features that we wanted present. 
* Github and IDEs included Gitpod and VSCode
    * Storing repositories and manipluating code cross party
* Slack
    * Video calls and messaging, allowing the team to keep communication free flowing
* Balsamiq
    * creating wireframes to plan our project

## Bugs

The project will be deployed on github pages however we may use heroku; this is yet to be debated.
